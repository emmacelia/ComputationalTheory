    "In this paper, the numbers game of the TV show Countdown will be discussed, including how to solve it. The French and English TV show has been running for over 50 years and both shows have a section that involves the contestants solving an arithmetic puzzle. Firstly, the game and approaches to solve it will be explained. Secondly, a demonstration on how to solve the numbers game of Countdown will be provided."

    "The countdown numbers game its quite complex to understand when you start to look at it. The aim of the game is to create a combination of 6 numbers using four basic operations to reach a target number. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the player starts the game there are 24 cards\n",
    "The 24 numbers contain the following:\n",
    "Small numbers -> two of 1 to 10\n",
    "Large numbers -> four of 25, 50, 75, 100\n",

    "- Player has 30 seconds to work out the calculation that is closest to the target number\n",
    "- May only use Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division (If no remainder)\n",

    "    N = {n1, n2,..., nk}\n",
    "\n",
    "The question that needs to be asked is whether it is possible to obtain the target number T by employing fundamental arithmetic operations using the numbers present in the set N. The decision problem is similar to the subset problem. The problem at hand involves a set of integers, and the objective is to ascertain whether there exists a subset of those integers that sums up to the given target number. As similar as they may be, the fact that the game uses adds an extra layer of complexity. It is not just about finding the subset but also about determining if arithmetic operations on those numbers can lead to the target value. Due to this fact, It can be computationally intensive and challenging. While the decision problem can find solutions quickly, finding an optimal solution can be challenging. \n"
