    "\n",
    "In this paper, the numbers game of the TV show Countdown is discussed, including how to solve it. The French and English TV show has been running for over 50 years and both shows have a section that involves the contestants solving an arithmetic puzzle. Firstly, the game and approaches to solve it will be explained. Secondly, a demonstration on how to solve the numbers game of Countdown will be provided."

    "## Problem Description \n",
    "### Explanation of game\n",
    "The countdown numbers game its quite complex to understand at the beginning. The aim of the game is to create a combination of 6 numbers using four basic operations to reach a target number. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the player starts the game there are 24 cards that contain the following:\n",
    "- Small numbers -> two of 1 to 10\n",
    "- Large numbers -> 25, 50, 75, 100\n",
    "\n",
    "6 cards are randomly chosen and placed on the board. The target figure containing 3 digits is randomly generated by a machine called CECIL.\n",
    "(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "As we have seen above, A contestant will choose Six numbers from the following list: \n",
    "- [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100]\n",
    "\n",
    "The contestant will attempt to reach the target number. \n",
    "\n",
    "The contestant chose the numbers 3, 6, 25, 50, 75 and 100. \n",
    "The target they much reach is 952. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of possible calulations:\n",
    "- 100 + 6 = 106\n",
    "- 75 * 3 = 225\n",
    "- 106 * 225 = 23850\n",
    "- 23850 - 50 = 23800\n",
    "- 23800 / 25 = 952\n",
    "\n",
    "(3)\n",
    "### Rules of the game\n",
    "- Player has 30 seconds to work out the calculation that is closest to the target number\n",
    "- May only use Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division\n",
    "- A number may not be used more than once\n",
    "- No fractions\n",
    "- Only positive integers\n",
    "- \n",
    "(1)\n",
    "### CECIL\n",
    "CECIL ia Countdown's Electronic Calculator In Leeds. It is a random number generator used on countdown however it doesn't not actually perform calculations. \n",
    "(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# British version vs French version\n",
    "The british version is as follows:\n",
    "- the target number is a value between 100 and 999\n",
    "- Contestants are given 30 seconds to solve the puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "However in the french version:\n",
    "- the target number is between 101 and 999 \n",
    "- Contestants are given 45 seconds to solve the puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input and output of the solve_numbers function \n",
    "The solve_numbers function has a few parameters which are the target number, the numbers that have been randomly generated and an output. The target will be used in the function to check if the output is equal to the target. The numbers will be used for calculations to reach the target number. The output is the output of all of the equations calculated. The output of the solve_numbers function will consist of a list of the closest numbers and the calculations which calculated the number."

    "The question that needs to be asked is whether it is possible to obtain the target number T by employing fundamental arithmetic operations using the numbers present in the set N. The decision problem is similar to the subset problem. The problem at hand involves a set of integers, and the objective is to ascertain whether there exists a subset of those integers that sums up to the given target number. As similar as they may be, the fact that the game uses adds an extra layer of complexity. It is not just about finding the subset but also about determining if arithmetic operations on those numbers can lead to the target value. Due to this fact, It can be computationally intensive and challenging. While the decision problem can find solutions quickly, finding an optimal solution can be challenging. \n"

    "The optimization problem however is more concerned with finding a solution that get the closest to the target number. This problem can often be more challenging as it involves finding the best combination of numbers and arithmetic operations. It must minimize the difference between the result and the target number. As above the target number T is a positive integer and the set of positive integers is defined as follows.\n",

    "#### Process\n",
    "1) Generate all possible combinations of numbers \n",
    "2) Once generated, each combination is evaluated by applying arithemetic operations to the combination of numbers\n",
    "3) The result is then compared to the target number. If the result matches the target number, it is considered a valid solution. \n",
    "4) Certain constraints must be observed such as each number must only be used once and avoiding fractions. \n",
    "5) The brute force process iteratively explores all possible combinations until a valid solution is found\n",

    "### Performance\n",
    "- Using a brute force approach as it can be impractical for a target number that is large or a large set of numbers. This can lead to a exponential time complexity. \n",
    "- The dynamic approach can require a significant memory usage, especially for larger numbers. This then can limit the scalability. \n",
    "- For complex target numbers, the heuristic approach may not give the optimal solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision\n",
    "- As there are constraints for the game such as integer arithmetic and rounding errors, solutions can produce results that can be slightly off from the target number.\n",
    "- As the heuristic approach can prioritize speed over precision which can make the accuracy fall. \n",
    "\n",

    "- In terms of edge cases, The algorithms may not take account for all edge cases. \n",

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, The analysis and implementation of the computational approaches to solving the countdown numbers game. This paper has provided insights into the challenges and strategies involved in tackling the complex problem. The paper has explored the brute force search, dynamic programming approach and a heuristic approach. This illustrates the different approaches to solving the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each method offers its own advantages and trade-offs, from the exhaustive search capabilities of brute force to the efficiency and the quick decision-making of heuristic methods.  The brute force approach, while straightforward, may suffer from scalability issues and computational overhead, especially for larger sets of numbers. On the other hand, heuristic methods offer a more streamlined approach, prioritizing speed and real-time decision-making, albeit with potential sacrifices in optimality. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper also acknowledges that there are limitations to the approaches, including limitations in performance, precision, and error handling. Looking ahead, there are several paths for future research and development. Refinements to the algorithms, such as optimizing the heuristic selection process or implementing parallel computing techniques, could enhance the efficiency and scalability of our solutions. In closing, the analysis done has shed light on the computational complexity of the Countdown numbers game and the diverse strategies available for solving it."
