    "In this paper, the numbers game of the TV show Countdown is discussed, including how to solve it. The French and English TV show has been running for over 50 years and both shows have a section that involves the contestants solving an arithmetic puzzle. Firstly, the game and approaches to solve it will be explained. Secondly, a demonstration on how to solve the numbers game of Countdown will be provided."

    "When the player starts the game there are 24 cards that contain the following:\n",
    "- Small numbers -> two of 1 to 10\n",
    "- Large numbers -> four of 25, 50, 75, 100\n",
    "\n",

The decision problem is similar to the subset problem. The problem at hand involves a set of integers, and the objective is to ascertain whether there exists a subset of those integers that sums up to the given target number. As similar as they may be, the fact that the game uses adds an extra layer of complexity. It is not just about finding the subset but also about determining if arithmetic operations on those numbers can lead to the target value. Due to this fact, It can be computationally intensive and challenging. While the decision problem can find solutions quickly, finding an optimal solution can be challenging. \n"

As above the target number T is a positive integer and the set of positive integers is defined as follows.\n",

However, it looks for a combination of operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division to apply to the numbers in the list. The main objective is to obtain a result that comes as close as possible to a specified target number. It is not always possible to get an exact match to the target, so this method focuses on finding the closest possible match."

    "- The dynamic approach can require a significant memory usage, especially for larger numbers. This then can limit the scalability. \n",
    "- For complex target numbers, the heuristic approach may not give the optimal solution. \n",

    "In conclusion, The analysis and implementation of the computational approaches to solving the countdown numbers game. This paper has provided insights into the challenges and strategies involved in tackling the complex problem. The paper has explored the brute force search, dynamic programming approach and a heuristic approach. This illustrates the different approaches to solving the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each method offers its own advantages and trade-offs, from the exhaustive search capabilities of brute force to the efficiency and the quick decision-making of heuristic methods.  The brute force approach, while straightforward, may suffer from scalability issues and computational overhead, especially for larger sets of numbers. On the other hand, heuristic methods offer a more streamlined approach, prioritizing speed and real-time decision-making, albeit with potential sacrifices in optimality. \n",
    "\n",
    "The paper also acknowledges that there are limitations to the approaches, including limitations in performance, precision, and error handling. Looking ahead, there are several paths for future research and development. Refinements to the algorithms, such as optimizing the heuristic selection process or implementing parallel computing techniques, could enhance the efficiency and scalability of our solutions. In closing, the analysis done has shed light on the computational complexity of the Countdown numbers game and the diverse strategies available for solving it."
